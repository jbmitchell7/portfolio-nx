# Portolio

This is a monorepo that contains my portfolio website as well as one of my biggest projects - a full stack fantasy football app.

# TC Fantasy Dashboard

This is an [Angular](https://angular.io/) full stack application that uses the [Sleeper App API](https://docs.sleeper.app/) as well as its own Mongo/Express back end to display standings and other insights on your favorite Sleeper fantasy league.

## Live Demo

To view the live site, visit [fantasy-dashboard.thundercloud.dev](https://fantasy-dashboard.thundercloud.dev). If you have a league ID enter it in the field, if not feel free to use 725424222041657344 as an example.
